# TransitOps — Smart Transport Operations Platform

TransitOps is a centralized transport operations platform designed to optimize fleet utilization, automate logistics dispatch, enforce compliance gates, track maintenance lifecycles, and monitor operational finances. 

Built specifically for the **Odoo Hackathon**, this project solves major logistics challenges by introducing real-time freight tracking, shared capacity utilization, and automated fleet management.

## 🎯 What This Solves (Hackathon Objectives)

1. **Real-Time Freight Visibility (The "Where is my cargo?" problem)**
   * **Solution:** We built a live tracking Shipper Portal using `Socket.io` and `Leaflet` maps. Drivers can broadcast their live GPS location, and customers can watch their cargo move on a map in real-time with zero-latency updates.
2. **Underutilized Fleet Capacity (The "Empty Miles" problem)**
   * **Solution:** A **Shared Capacity Marketplace**. If a truck is dispatched with only partial load, the manager or driver can "Share Capacity", publishing the remaining space (e.g., 500 KG available) for other shippers to book at a calculated price-per-kg.
3. **Compliance & Safety Risks**
   * **Solution:** Automated dispatch gating. The system physically prevents dispatching drivers with expired licenses, poor safety scores, or vehicles currently marked "In Shop" for maintenance.
4. **Disjointed Financial Tracking**
   * **Solution:** Centralized analytics that automatically calculate Vehicle ROI, fuel efficiency, and maintenance burn rates across the entire fleet.

## 🚀 Core Features Built

### 🗺 Real-Time Tracking & Shipper Portal
* **Live GPS Broadcasting:** Drivers click "Go Live" to stream their device's actual geolocation directly to the server.
* **Customer Map Dashboard:** Customers use a public tracking link to view a live OpenStreetMap with their cargo's exact location, speed, and moving route trail.
* **Manual Checkpoints:** Drivers can drop manual GPS pins (with reverse-geocoded location names) if continuous streaming drops.

### 🤝 Shared Capacity Marketplace
* **Dynamic Space Calculation:** The system automatically calculates remaining vehicle weight capacity.
* **Route Publishing:** Active trips can publish their extra space along a route with a specific price quote.
* **Booking Integration:** Customers can view shared routes and book the extra space, instantly increasing the vehicle's ROI for that trip.

### 🚚 Vehicle & Asset Management
* **Centralized Registry:** Track registration numbers, models, purchase details, and current odometer readings.
* **Real-Time Status Tracking:** Monitor vehicle availability states (`Available`, `On Trip`, `In Shop`, `Retired`).
* **Fleet Health Tracking:** Automated status updates based on active maintenance logs.

### 👥 Driver Compliance & Profile Management
* **Driver Registry:** Store driver information, license categories, and safety ratings.
* **Automated Expiry Warnings:** Monitor driver license expiration dates to prevent expired dispatches.

### 📅 Trip Planning & Automated Dispatch
* **Intelligent Dispatching:** Select available vehicles and qualified drivers for new dispatches.
* **Dynamic Resource Gating:** Prevent selection of busy, retired, suspended, or maintenance-bound assets.
* **Payload Capacity Verification:** Enforce cargo weight limits against vehicle load capabilities.

### 🔧 Maintenance & Repairs
* **Shop Locking:** Mark vehicles as `In Shop` while maintenance logs are open, automatically releasing them back to `Available` upon completion.

### 📊 Reports & Operational Analytics
* **KPI Metrics Dashboard:** Compute Fleet Utilization, Driver Statuses, and Active Trips dynamically.
* **Fleet Analytics:**
    * **Fleet Utilization (%)** = (Vehicles on Trip / Total Available Fleet) * 100
    * **Fuel Efficiency** = Distance Traveled (km) / Fuel Consumed (Liters)
    * **Vehicle ROI** = (Trip Revenue - Costs) / Acquisition Cost

## ⚙️ Operational Business Rules Enforced

The system acts as a smart ledger, automatically enforcing these rules:

1.  **Dispatch Gating:** Vehicles marked `Retired` or `In Shop` are excluded from trip dispatch selection pools.
2.  **Driver Compliance Gating:** Drivers with expired licenses or a `Suspended` status cannot be assigned to trips.
3.  **Double Assignment Prevention:** Drivers or vehicles marked `On Trip` cannot be assigned to another trip.
4.  **Payload Capacity Gating:** Cargo weight must not exceed the selected vehicle's maximum load capacity.
5.  **Trip Lifecycle Status Transitions:**
    *   `Draft` &rarr; `Dispatched`: Automatically changes vehicle and driver status to `On Trip`.
    *   `Dispatched` &rarr; `Completed`: Automatically restores vehicle and driver status to `Available` and updates the vehicle's odometer.
6.  **Maintenance Status Transitions:**
    *   Creating an active maintenance log changes vehicle status to `In Shop`.
    *   Closing the maintenance log restores the vehicle status to `Available`.
